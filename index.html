            <h2>About Lion -The King</h2>
            <p>Lion, (Panthera leo), large, powerfully built cat (family Felidae) that is second in size only to the
                tiger; it is a famous apex predator (meaning without a natural predator or enemy). The proverbial “king
                of beasts,” the lion has been one of the best-known wild animals since earliest times. Lions are most
                active at night and live in a variety of habitats but prefer grassland, savanna, dense scrub, and open
                woodland. Historically, they ranged across much of Europe, Asia, and Africa, but now they are found
                mainly in parts of Africa south of the Sahara. An isolated population of about 650 Asiatic lions
                constitute a slightly smaller race that lives under strict protection in India’s Gir National Park and
                Wildlife Sanctuary.</p>
